I demonstrate my ability to learn the language quickly. The code demonstrates recursion instead of using the built-in loop syntaxes.

Also demonstrated the usage of catching errors with if-else statements instead of having to use its "panic" syntax to implement checking the user input for something that will deem as a wrong input.
